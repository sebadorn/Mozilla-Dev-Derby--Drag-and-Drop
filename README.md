# Mozilla Dev Derby: Drag&Drop

*This is a (very) short story about someone named Pete. And Pete needs a little bit of your help.*

My entry for the [Mozilla Dev Derby](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/devderby) in January 2013. The topic was Drag&Drop.  
[Here is the submission.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/demos/detail/petes-adventure)  
First place! [Here is an interview with me.](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/07/interview-with-sebastian-dorn-winner-of-the-drag-and-drop-dev-derby/)

Of course I hope you figure out yourself what to do. But maybe it is not always obvious enough. So here is a little walkthrough:

0: Start screen.  
1: Drag'n'Drop a file (size matters) on that green lump of slime.  
2: See the note in the slimy remains? Drag'n'Drop it on Pete.  
3: Drag'n'Drop an image file on the checkered part of the shirt.  
4: End.
